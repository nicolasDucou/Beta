# Improvements and Bug Reports
Hal configuration :

- HAL.ABB version : 1.1.10-beta
 
I am using Rhinoceros 5.0 with Grasshopper version : 0.9.76.0, running on a virtual machine using VirtualBox with windows 10 lite.  

2. Action : I just select controller component and try to select one.

When i try to select a controller, double-clicking on the respected component, the list of available appears, but the blue bar permitting to validate the choice does not. Then I can select a controller but I cannot validate the choice.. That prevent me from using the software..
There is the same problem with the robot menu.
